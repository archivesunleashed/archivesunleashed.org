## Warclight

Warclight is a [Project Blacklight](http://projectblacklight.org/) based [Rails engine](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/engines.html) that supports the discovery of web archives held in the WARC and ARC formats. It allows faceted full-text search, record view, and other advanced discovery options.
