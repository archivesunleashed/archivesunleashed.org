## Archives Unleashed Events
![Material Screenshot](/images/washington-hackathon.png)

Cognizant of funded projects that run into sustainability issues following a successful launch, we regard regional datathons staged under the Archives Unleashed banner as vital to ensuring broad community buy-in and continued involvement, while leveraging an open-source ecosystem.

Web archives often contain hundreds of billions of web pages, ranging from individual homepages and social media posts, to institutional websites. These archives offer tremendous potential for social scientists and humanists, and the questions research may pose stretch across a multitude of fields. Scholars broaching topics dating back to the mid-1990s will find their projects enhanced by web data. Moreover, scholars hoping to study the evolution of cultural and societal phenomena will find a treasure trove of data in web archives. In short, web archives offer the ability to reconstruct large-scale traces of the relatively recent past.


## Upcoming Research Opportunities

To support and facilitate continued engagement with web archivesthe, Archives Unleashed is launching the **Cohort Program**. Research Cohorst will participate in a year-long collaboration while receiving mentorship and support from the Archives Unleashed Team. Cohorts will begin in July 2021 and July 2022.

The Call for Proposals for the first round of cohorts is open until **31 March 2021**. 

Visit the [Cohort Program](/cohorts) page for full details. 


## Past Datathons

Our **datathon model** brings together researchers, programmers, visualization experts, memory institutional professionals and others to collaboratively work with web collections and explore cutting-edge research tools through hands on experience.

The Archives Unleashed team has had the pleasure of hosting several datathons. Follow the past event pages to learn more about each datathon, including projects completed by attendees.
