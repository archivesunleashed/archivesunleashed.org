{{< warning title="Event Updates" >}}
Due to the rapidly-evolving COVID-19 pandemic situation, we have decided to hold our March 26-27 Archives Unleashed event as an online-only event. Our thanks again to our attendees for their patience and help as we navigate this shift.

As the IIPC Web Archiving Conference has been postponed until September 2020, we have also canceled our datathon that was part of that larger event.

## About our Datathons

| ![Toronto Datathon](/images/IMG_2614.JPG) | One of our key priorities is sustainability: crucial to the projectâ€™s success is leveraging an open-source ecosystem. Cognizant of funded projects that run into sustainability issues following a successful launch, we regard regional datathons staged under the Archives Unleashed banner as vital to ensuring broad community buy-in and continued involvement. The datathon model brings together researchers, programmers, visualization experts, graphical designers, and others into one room in order to facilitate their intensive collaboration on a shared project. In our case, programmers, academics, memory institution professionals, and other librarians will gather to work on accessing web archives with our cloud interface. |
