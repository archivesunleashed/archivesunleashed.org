## About

Big Data, in the form of born-digital historical sources, is reshaping the humanities and social sciences. The sheer amount of cultural information that is generated and, crucially, preserved every day in electronic form, presents exciting new opportunities for historians, political scientists, sociologists, linguistics, computer scientists, and other scholars. Much of this information is captured within web archives, created by organizations such as the Internet Archive and many other libraries.

The Archives Unleashed project is pleased to announce  the launch of the **Cohort Program**, which will facilitate research engagement with web archives. Cohorts will engage in a year-long collaboration, while receiving mentorship and support from the Archives Unleashed Team.

## Program Details

We are looking to select up to **five cohorts** in the July 2021 to June 2022 period who will receive the following support:

* **Participate** in cohort events which will provide an introduction to web archives and an opportunity to workshop draft work in a supportive environment.
	* Opening event: virtual, due to COVID-19 [July 2021]
	* Closing event: Internet Archive, San Francisco, California, United States [Tentatively May 2022]
* **Bi-monthly mentorship** and support meetings with the Archives Unleashed team;
* **Access to the Archive-It Research Cloud** to generate custom datasets; and
* **Funding** of $11,500 CAD to support project work. Additional support will be provided for travel to the Internet Archive event.

It is expected that all teams will **prepare a journal-length article submission** as part of this project, which will be developed throughout the term and workshopped at the closing event at the Internet Archive.

## The Cohorts

**The Cohorts** can be disciplinary or interdisciplinary and should include no more than five individuals. Graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, and those in precarious or sessional positions are welcome to apply; however, an administrative lead must be in place at an institution eligible to administer and receive grant funds. This would regularly be a full-time faculty member.

The University of Waterloo regards diversity as an integral part of academic excellence and is committed to accessibility for persons with disabilities. As such, we encourage applications from women, First Nations, Metis and Inuit peoples, persons with disabilities, members of diverse gender identities, and others who may contribute to the further diversification of ideas.

**The Data**: With our recently announced integration with Archive-It, data available for use will primarily be institution web archive collections in Archive-It (https://archive-it.org). Additional datasets from the overall Wayback Machine and Internet Archive may also be available. We are happy to work with applicants to address any questions; please connect with [Samantha Fritz](mailto:samantha.fritz@uwaterloo.ca).

Submissions will be evaluated on the following criteria:
* demonstration of a feasible project that will make an impact on the scholarâ€™s field of study;
* the selection of specific web archives to help achieve that project;
* suitability of the project team to learn and carry out planned activities; and
* suitable documentation of a web archival collection that can support this research.

## Project Inspiration

Need some ideas to inspire your Cohort proposal? We've listed a few recent projects to showcase the variety of ways web archives can be explored, used, and visualized.

* [Assessing Local Journalism: News Deserts, Journalism Divides, and the Determinants of the Robustness of Local News](https://dewitt.sanford.duke.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Assessing-Local-Journalism_100-Communities.pdf) by Philip M. Napoli, Matthew Weber, Katie McCollough & Qun Wang. 
* [The invention and dissemination of the spacer gif: implications for the future of access and use of web archives](https://doi.org/10.1007/s42803-019-00006-8) by Trevor Owens & Grace Thomas. Building on this research, Nick Ruest explored a GeoCities dataset using the Archives Unleashed Toolkit in [GeoCities and the spacer.gif](https://news.archivesunleashed.org/geocities-and-the-spacer-gif-6a0f70e7ad5d)
* [The Queer Eternal September: LGBTQ Identity on the Early Internet and Web](https://uwspace.uwaterloo.ca/handle/10012/16336) by Sarah McTavish.

* Selected Archives Unleashed Datathon Projects:

## FAQ

We've provided help with the most common questions about the Cohort application. Still have questions? Feel free to reach out to our team on [Slack](http://slack.archivesunleashed.org/) or connect with [Samantha Fritz](mailto:samantha.fritz@uwaterloo.ca).

### Cohorts

**Q**. _I've never been to an Archives Unleashed Datathon or collaborated with the project before, can I still apply?_

**A**. Absolutely! The Cohort program is a completed different setting for engaging in web archives research, so applicants don't have to have attended any of our events. The make-up of your cohort is very flexible; co-applicants can be disciplinary/inter-disciplinary, multi-institutional, and at various career stages. Just remember that there needs to someone on the grant who can administer funds.

### Datasets

**Q**. _What kind of collections should be used for project proposals?_

**A**. We recommend that applicants prioritize using existing curated web archive collections stewarded by institutional partners in the [Archive-It ecosystem](https://archive-it.org/explore). Although specialized collections created via data extractions from the overall Wayback Machine web archive may be possible in some cases, it will be dependent on the availability of resources based on the grant funding.
