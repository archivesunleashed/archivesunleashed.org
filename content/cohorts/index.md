## About

Big Data, in the form of born-digital historical sources, is reshaping the humanities and social sciences. The sheer amount of cultural information that is generated and, crucially, preserved every day in electronic form, presents exciting new opportunities for historians, political scientists, sociologists, linguistics, computer scientists, and other scholars. Much of this information is captured within web archives, created by organizations such as the Internet Archive and many other libraries.

The Archives Unleashed project is pleased to announce  the launch of the **Cohort Program**, which will facilitate research engagement with web archives. Cohorts will engage in a year-long collaboration, while receiving mentorship and support from the Archives Unleashed Team.

## Program Details

We are looking to select up to **five cohorts** in the July 2021 to June 2022 period who will receive the following support:

* **Participate** in cohort events which will provide an introduction to web archives and an opportunity to workshop draft work in a supportive environment.
	* Opening event: virtual, due to COVID-19 [July 2021]
	* Closing event: Internet Archive, San Francisco, California, United States [Tentatively May 2022]
* **Bi-monthly mentorship** and support meetings with the Archives Unleashed team;
* **Access to the Archive-It Research Cloud** to generate custom datasets; and
* **Funding** of $11,500 CAD in to support project work.

It is expected that all teams will **prepare a journal-length article submission** as part of this project, which will be developed throughout the term and workshopped at the closing event at the Internet Archive.

## The Cohorts

**The Cohorts** can be disciplinary or interdisciplinary and should include no more than five individuals. Graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, and those in precarious or sessional positions are welcome to apply; however, an administrative lead must be in place at an institution eligible to administer and receive grant funds. This would regularly be a full-time faculty member.

The University of Waterloo regards diversity as an integral part of academic excellence and is committed to accessibility for persons with disabilities. As such, we encourage applications from women, First Nations, Metis and Inuit peoples, persons with disabilities, members of diverse gender identities, and others who may contribute to the further diversification of ideas.

**The Data**: With our recently announce integration with Archive-It, data available for use will primarily be institution web archive collections in Archive-it (https://archive-it.org). Additional datasets from the overall Wayback Machine and Internet Archive may also be available. We are happy to work with applicants to address any questions; please connect with [Samantha Fritz](mailto:samantha.fritz@uwaterloo.ca).
