## About

Big Data, in the form of born-digital historical sources, is reshaping the humanities and social sciences. The sheer amount of cultural information that is generated and, crucially, preserved every day in electronic form, presents exciting new opportunities for historians, political scientists, sociologists, linguistics, computer scientists, and other scholars. Much of this information is captured within web archives, created by organizations such as the Internet Archive and many other libraries.
Building on our previous Archives Unleashed datathons, Archives Unleashed is excited to announce the Archives Unleashed Cohort program.

## Program Details

We are looking to select **five cohorts** in the July 2021 to June 2022 period who will receive the following support:

* **Participate** in virtual opening event in July 2021;
* **Travel support** to a closing event at the Internet Archive (San Francisco, California, United States; May 2022);
	* These events will include an introduction to web archives and an opportunity to workshop draft work in a supportive environment.
* **Bi-weekly mentorship** and support meetings with the Archives Unleashed team;
* **Computational support** including storage, computational resources, and storage; and
* $7,500 CAD **additional funding** to support the project.

The expectation is that all teams will **prepare a journal-length article submission** as part of this project, which will be developed throughout the term and workshopped at the closing May 2022 event at the Internet Archive.

## The Cohorts

**The Cohorts**: can be disciplinary or interdisciplinary and should include no more than five individuals. Graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, and those in precarious or sessional positions are welcome to apply; however, an administrative lead must be in place at an institution eligible to administer and receive grant funds. This would regularly be a full-time faculty member.

The University of Waterloo regards diversity as an integral part of academic excellence and is committed to accessibility for persons with disabilities. As such, we encourage applications from women, First Nations, Metis and Inuit peoples, persons with disabilities, members of diverse gender identities, and others who may contribute to the further diversification of ideas.

**The Data**: web archive datasets should be drawn from [Archive-It](https://archive-it.org). We are happy to work with applicants to discuss available collections, please e-mail [Samantha Fritz](mailto:samantha.fritz@uwaterloo.ca).
