Supported by a new grant by [The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation](https://mellon.org/), Archives Unleashed is partnering with our colleagues at the [Internet Archive](https://archive.org). We will be integrating the Cloud with their [Archive-It service](https://archive-it.org) in order to ensure the projectâ€™s long-term sustainability, as well as enhance usability and accessibility.

## The Project

The Archives Unleashed project aims to make petabytes of historical internet content accessible to scholars and others interested in researching the recent past. Supported by [The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation](https://mellon.org/), we develop web archive search and data analysis tools to enable scholars, librarians and archivists to access, share, and investigate recent history since the early days of the World Wide Web.
