There are many ways you can participate in the Archives Unleashed Project. 

|   |   |
|---|---|
|![In-Person Events](/images/GI-Participate.png)| Building on the success of our [previous datathons](/events), we will be launching the **[Archives Unleashed Cohort program](/cohorts)** to engage with and support web archives research. The Cohorts will see research teams participate in year-long intensive collaborations and receive mentorship from the Archives Unleashed team to produce a realized research project, such as a full-length article manuscript. Cohorts will begin in July 2021 and July 2022.|
