The Archives Unleashed Project aims to make petabytes of historical internet content accessible to scholarls and others interested in researching the recent past. 

The project grew out of a [series of datathons](https://archivesunleashed.org/events/) held at the University of Toronto, Library of Congress, Internet Archive, and the British Library, as our team recognized the need for better analytics tools, community infrastructure, and accessible web archival interfaces. Supported by a grant from The [Andrew W. Mellon Foundation](https://mellon.org/), the team developed web archive search and data analysis tools from 2017 to 2020. 

We continue our work to enable scholars, librarians, and archivists to access, share, and investigate recent history since the early days of the World Wide Web.

Starting in June 2020, the project entered a [second phase](https://uwaterloo.ca/arts/news/archives-unleashed-project-scales-archive-it-better) with the support of second grant from The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation. The principal aim of this phase is to extend and sustain Archives Unleashed by integrating the Cloud with the Internet Archive’s [Archive-It](https://archive-it.org) service. 

Over three years, the team will be engaged in two priorities: First, we will be integrating the Archives Unleashed Cloud with the Internet Archive's Archive-It Service. Secondly, to facilitate researcher engagement with web archives, we will be planning the Archives Unleashed Cohorts program. Stay tuned for more detail.
