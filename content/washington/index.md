## About

The World Wide Web has had a profound impact on how we research and understand the past. The sheer amount of cultural information that is generated and, crucially, preserved every day in electronic form, presents exciting new opportunities for researchers. Much of this information is captured within web archives.

The project team invites archivists, researchers (from the humanities, social sciences, and beyond), librarians, computer scientists, and web archiving enthusiasts to join us over the course of two days to collaboratively work with web collections and explore cutting-edge research tools through hands-on experience.

The Archives Unleashed Team has partnered with <a href="https://library.gwu.edu">**George Washington University Libraries**</a> to host the next Archives Unleashed datathon.

This event will bring together a small group of **approximately 15-20 participants** to experiment with the newest release of AUT (Archives Unleashed Toolkit) and the Archives Unleashed Cloud, and to kick-off collaboratively inspired research projects. Participants will have access to analytics software and specialists, and will be exposed to the process of working with web archive files at scale.

For more information on AUT and the Cloud, please visit <http://archivesunleashed.org/>.

## Travel to Washington

The Archives Unleashed team has put together some information and resources to help with your travel plans.

![Accommodations](/images/accommodations.png)

There are many choices for accommodations in the DC area! We encourage all of our out-of-town participants to check out the [DC Metro Rail Map](https://www.wmata.com/schedules/maps/upload/2017-System-Map.pdf) to help spot areas close to campus. The Gelman Library is located near the Foggy Bottom-GWU station.

You can easily access the Blue, Yellow, and Silver Lines that run to the Foggy Bottom Station. If staying outside the city center, we'd recommend sticking to areas near Arlington, Pentagon, and Crystal City.

Staying in Washington doesn’t have to break the bank, which is why we like using some of the following aggregators to compare hotel rates:

* [Airbnb](https://www.airbnb.ca)
* [Kayak](https://www.ca.kayak.com)
* [Expedia](https://www.expedia.ca)
* [Trivago](https://www.trivago.ca)
* [Travelocity](https://www.travelocity.ca)

![Airports](/images/airports.png)

For guests flying into Washington, there are two main airports with several options for reaching downtown Washington, DC.

* **Public Transport** - Metrorail provides access to public transportation in Washington. They have a great [trip planner](https://www.wmata.com/schedules/trip-planner/).
