## About

The Archives Unleashed Team has partnered with **[George Washington University Libraries](https://library.gwu.edu)** to host the next Archives Unleashed datathon.

This event will bring together a small group of approximately 15-20 participants to experiment with the newest release of AUT (Archives Unleashed Toolkit) and the Archives Unleashed Cloud, and to kick-off collaboratively inspired research projects. Participants will have access to analytics software and specialists, and will be exposed to the process of working with web archive files at scale.

## Schedule

We are looking forward to spending a couple of days with our participants. We will be kicking off the event with some discussion around the project and set up of the Archives Unleashed Toolkit. The majority of datathon time will be spent on team project work. A light breakfast and lunch will be provided on both days, and there will be plenty of coffee and tea throughout the event!
