## About

The World Wide Web has had a profound impact on how we research and understand the past. The sheer amount of cultural information that is generated and, crucially, preserved every day in electronic form, presents exciting new opportunities for researchers. Much of this information is captured within web archives.

The project team invites archivists, researchers (from the humanities, social sciences, and beyond), librarians, computer scientists, and web archiving enthusiasts to join us over the course of two days to collaboratively work with web collections and explore cutting-edge research tools through hands-on experience.

The Archives Unleashed Team has partnered with <a href="https://library.gwu.edu">**George Washington University Libraries**</a> to host the next Archives Unleashed datathon.

This event will bring together a small group of **approximately 15-20 participants** to experiment with the newest release of AUT (Archives Unleashed Toolkit) and the Archives Unleashed Cloud, and to kick-off collaboratively inspired research projects. Participants will have access to analytics software and specialists, and will be exposed to the process of working with web archive files at scale.

For more information on AUT and the Cloud, please visit http://archivesunleashed.org/.

## Travel Grants

This event is possible thanks to the generous support of the <a href="https://mellon.org"> Andrew W. Mellon Foundation </a>, <a href="https://www.lib.sfu.ca"> George Washington University Libraries </a>, <a href="https://library.gwu.edu"> University of Waterloo’s Faculty of Arts </a>, <a href="http://www.yorku.ca"> York University Libraries </a>, <a href="https://www.computecanada.ca"> Compute Canada</a>, and <a href="http://www.startsmartlabs.com"> Start Smart Labs</a>.

## Travel to Washington

The Archives Unleashed team has put together some information and resources to help with your travel plans.

![Accommodations](/images/accommodations.png)

There are many choices for accommodations in the DC area! We encourage all of our out-of-town participants to check out the [DC Metro Rail Map](https://www.wmata.com/schedules/maps/upload/2017-System-Map.pdf) to help spot areas close to campus. The Gelman Library is located near the Foggy Bottom-GWU station.

You can easily access the Blue, Yellow, and Silver Lines that run to the Foggy Bottom Station. If staying outside the city center, we'd recommend sticking to areas near Arlington, Pentagon, and Crystal City.

Staying in Washington doesn’t have to break the bank, which is why we like using some of the following aggregators to compare hotel rates:

* [Airbnb](https://www.airbnb.ca)
* [Kayak](https://www.ca.kayak.com)
* [Expedia](https://www.expedia.ca)
* [Trivago](https://www.trivago.ca)
* [Travelocity](https://www.travelocity.ca)

![Airports](/images/airports.png)

For guests flying into Washington, there are two main airports with several options for reaching downtown Washington, DC.

Staying to Washington doesn’t have to break the bank, which is why we like using some of the following aggregators to compare hotel rates:

* [Airbnb](https://www.airbnb.ca) (great option to find reasonably priced accommodations)
* [Kayak](https://www.ca.kayak.com)
* [Expedia](https://www.expedia.ca)
* [Trivago](https://www.trivago.ca)
* [Travelocity](https://www.travelocity.ca)

![Airports](/images/airports.png)

For guests flying into Washington, there are two main airports

* [Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport](http://www.flyreagan.com/dca/reagan-national-airport), which is located
* [Washington Dulles International Airport](http://flydulles.com/iad/dulles-international-airport), which is about 25miles (40km) from the downtown core.

There are a few options for getting downtown:

* **[SkyTrain](https://www.translink.ca/Schedules-and-Maps/SkyTrain.aspx)** – Probably the easiest and most cost efficient way of getting to downtown. From YVR to Waterfront Station, follow signs to "Canada Line". Trains leave every 7 minutes during peak hours and every 15 minutes during off hours. It is an approximate 25min ride and you ticket can be used for 90 minutes to transfer to buses and other Vancouver Skytrain stations.

> **Note**:
  - If you're just coming in for the event, buying *single tickets* is best - it'll be $9.20 during the day and $7.95 during evening/weekends to go from Airport to Waterfront. There is a $5 fee for all trips leaving YVR. Return trip will be $2.95 or $4.20.
  - For those who plan to stay a bit longer or use transit around the city, it's worth buying a *[Compass Card](https://www.compasscard.ca)*! It's a stored-value card that will let you use transit around Metro Vancouver. Alternatively you can use your credit card's "tap to pay" function as discussed below.

* **[Taxi](http://www.yvr.ca/en/passengers/transportation/taxis)** - [zone fare](http://www.yvr.ca/en/passengers/transportation/taxis) taxis are available outside level 2 of the Domestic and International Arrivals Area, but always check with your driver before your leave. Metered rates apply on return to YVR.

* **[Car rentals]()** are also available .

No Compass card needed! Info about this program can be found [here](https://www.translink.ca/Fares-and-Passes/Tap-to-Pay.aspx).
