## **About**

The Archives Unleashed Team partnered with **[Columbia University Libraries](https://library.columbia.edu)** to host the fourth Archives Unleashed datathon. This event brought together archivists, researchers (from the humanities, social sciences, and beyond), librarians, computer scientists, and web archiving enthusiasts to collaboratively work with web collections and explore cutting-edge research tools through hands-on experience.
