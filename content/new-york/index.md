## **About**

We invite archivists, researchers (from the humanities, social sciences, and beyond), librarians, computer scientists, and web archiving enthusiasts to join us over the course of two days to collaboratively work with web collections and explore cutting-edge research tools through hands-on experience.

The Archives Unleashed Team has partnered with <a href="https://library.columbia.edu">**Columbia University Libraries**</a> to host the fourth Archives Unleashed datathon.

This event will bring together a small group to experiment with the newest release of the Archives Unleashed Toolkit and Cloud, and to kick-off collaboratively inspired research projects. Participants will have access to analytics software and specialists, and will be exposed to the process of working with web archive files at scale.
