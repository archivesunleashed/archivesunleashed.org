## About

The World Wide Web has a profound impact on how we research and understand the past. The sheer amount of cultural information that is generated and, crucially, preserved every day in electronic form, presents exciting new opportunities for researchers. Much of this information is captured within web archives.

The project team We invite archivists, researchers (from the humanities, social sciences, and beyond), librarians, computer scientists, and web archiving enthusiasts to join us over the course of two days to collaboratively work with web collections and explore cutting-edge research tools through hands-on experience.

The Archives Unleashed Team has partnered with <a href="https://www.lib.sfu.ca">**Simon Fraser University Library**</a>, and <a href="http://www.sfu.ca/key/">**KEY**</a>  (SFU’s Big Data initiative) to host the next Archives Unleashed datathon.

This event will bring together a small group of **approximately 15-20 participants** to experiment with the newest release of AUT (Archives Unleashed Toolkit) and the Archives Unleashed Cloud, and to kick-off collaboratively inspired research projects. Participants will have access to analytics software and specialists, and will be exposed to the process of working with web archive files at scale. 

For more information on AUT and the Cloud, please visit http://archivesunleashed.org/. 

Check to see when Archives Unleashed will be near you…

## Travel to Vancouver

The AUT team has put together some helpful information and resources to help with your travel plans.

![Accommodations](/images/accommodations.png)

While there is no designated hotel the datathon will be using, we have highlighted some options near the Harbour Centre. Please note, we have no relationship nor do we receive financial return from any of these providers. Any rates mentioned are presented as a reference and might be higher at the time of your booking. We highly encourage you to shop around and book early as space can fill up quickly.

Staying to Vancouver doesn’t have to break the bank, which is why we like using some of the following aggregators to compare hotel rates:

* Airbnb (great option to find reasonably priced accommodations)
* Kayak
* Expedia
* Trivago
* Travelocity

There are also a few hotel options listed here:

| Accommodation Option                                                                                          | Average Cost    | Distance to Robarts Library |
|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|-----------------------------|
| [Downtown Home Inn](http://www.downtownhomeinn.com/index.html)                                                | Avg. $85-145 CND     | Approx. 1.7km               |
| [Holiday Inn Toronto Downtown Centre](https://www.ihg.com/holidayinn/hotels/us/en/toronto/yyzct/hoteldetail ) | Starts $190 CND | Approx. 2km                 |

![Airports](/images/airports.png)

For guests flying into Toronto there are two main airports, one located downtown and one located outside of the city centre. 

[**Toronto Pearson International Airport | YYZ**](http://www.torontopearson.com/) - located approximately 30 km away from downtown, there are a few options for getting to the downtown core:

* [Union Pearson Express Train](https://www.upexpress.com/) – Probably the easiest and most cost efficient way of getting to downtown. The train takes approximately 25 minutes and leaves every 15 minutes, with an adult return ticket of $25CND. You will take the UPExpress to Union Station (downtown). 

* [Taxis](http://www.torontopearson.com/en/toandfrom/taxilimo/#) to downtown Toronto are available outside both airport terminals. A taxi will run about $60 CND+, but be sure to confirm fare with driver before you leave.

* [Public Transit – Toronto Transit Commission (TTC)](http://www.ttc.ca/Trip_planner/index.jsp) To make things a little simpler, we've provided a link to the TTC trip planner. There are a variety of options for transit including the subway, buses and streetcars. A cash single fare purchase will run $3.25CND; additional information about [TTC fares](https://www.ttc.ca/Fares_and_passes/Prices/Prices.jsp)

[**Billy Bishop Toronto City Airport | YTZ**](http://www.torontoport.com/Airport/Getting-To.aspx) via [Porter Airline](https://www.flyporter.com/) - located downtown Toronto. It’s called the island airport, because the tarmac is quite literally on an island. Once you arrive just follow the signs to reach the airport exit. A complimentary shuttle is available from Billy Bishop to downtown with stops located along major subway routes. 

* You can also book with [Aeroport Taxi](http://www.aeroporttaxi.com/billy-bishop-airport-taxi/) 
 
![Downtown Transit](/images/transit.png)
While you are in Toronto there are a few ways to get around, but ultimately it will depend on how close you are to campus. The Robarts Library is part of the University of Toronto's St. George Campus. 

* [Public Transit – Toronto Transit Commission (TTC)](http://www.ttc.ca/Trip_planner/index.jsp) If you are taking subway Line 1, St. George Station is the closest stop to the Robarts Library. 
* Parking (Green P) - You can check out [Toronto’s Parking Authority Website](https://parking.greenp.com/) or download the App (Green P) to your iOS device to find and/or pay for parking. This will most likely be the easiest and most economical choice if you are driving. Please remember that our event is during regular work hours, so campus parking spots and street parking may be limited.
