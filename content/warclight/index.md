[Warclight](https://github.com/archivesunleashed/warclight) is a [Project Blacklight](http://projectblacklight.org/) based [Rails engine](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/engines.html) that supports the discovery of web archives held in the WARC and ARC formats. It allows faceted full-text search, record view, and other advanced discovery options. Warclight is designed to work with web archive data that is indexed via the UK Web Archive's [webarchive-discovery](https://github.com/ukwa/webarchive-discovery) project. This project grew out of the [WALK Project](https://uwaterloo.ca/web-archive-group/news/compute-canada-grant-web-archives-longitudinal-knowledge).
