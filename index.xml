      <description>Archives Unleashed aims to make petabytes of historical internet content accessible to scholars and others interested in researching the recent past. Supported by a grant from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, we will be developing web archive search and data analysis tools to enable scholars and librarians to access, share, and investigate recent history since the early days of the World Wide Web.
Growing out of a series of datathons held at the University of Toronto, Library of Congress, Internet Archive, and the British Library, our team recognized the need for better analytics tools, community infrastructure, and accessible web archival interfaces.</description>

      <description>Under construction!
The Archives Unleashed Cloud is under construction &amp;mdash; but here&amp;rsquo;s a sneak peak! We&amp;rsquo;ll have more information here soon.
 The Archives Unleashed Cloud makes the Archives Unleashed Toolkit more accessible. It is a web-based front end that allows users to access their web archival collections and analyze them with AUT using a web-based interface.
Interested in the Archives Unleashed Cloud? Check out our repository or you can see some screenshots below.</description>

The Archives Unleashed Toolkit is an open-source platform for managing web archives built on Hadoop. The platform provides a flexible data model for storing and managing raw content as well as metadata and extracted knowledge. Tight integration with Hadoop provides powerful tools for analytics and data processing via Spark.
Getting Started Quick Start If you don&amp;rsquo;t want to install all the dependencies locally, you can use docker-aut.</description>

      <description>Warclight is a Project Blacklight based Rails engine that supports the discovery of web archives held in the WARC and ARC formats. It allows faceted full-text search, record view, and other advanced discovery options. Warclight is designed to work with web archive data that is indexed via the UK Web Archive&amp;rsquo;s webarchive-discovery project.
Want to know more? You can visit our demo site here, or check out the code on GitHub along with documetation to get you started on your own Warclight application.</description>

      <description>Toronto, April 2018 The Archives Unleashed team is pleased to announce our first datathon will be hosted in partnership with the University of Toronto Libraries this spring! Save the date for 26-27 April 2018.
Watch this space for the call for participation to follow in early December.
About our Datathons One of our key priorities is sustainability: crucial to the projectâ€™s success is leveraging an open-source ecosystem. Cognizant of funded projects that run into sustainability issues following a successful launch, we regard regional datathons staged under the Archives Unleashed banner as vital to ensuring broad community buy-in and continued involvement.</description>

      <description>About The World Wide Web has a profound impact on how we research and understand the past. The sheer amount of cultural information that is generated and, crucially, preserved every day in electronic form, presents exciting new opportunities for researchers. Much of this information is captured within web archives.
Web archives often contain hundreds of billions of web pages, ranging from individual homepages and social media posts, to institutional websites.</description>
