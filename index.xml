      <description>The Archives Unleashed Project aims to make petabytes of historical internet content accessible to scholars and others interested in researching the recent past.
The project grew out of a series of datathons held at the University of Toronto, Library of Congress, Internet Archive, and the British Library, as our team recognized the need for better analytics tools, community infrastructure, and accessible web archival interfaces. Supported by a grant from The Andrew W.</description>

      <description>Introduction The Archive Research Compute Hub, or ARCH, is our new interface for web archive analysis that we are creating with the Internet Archive.
ARCH unlocks the research potential of web archival collections with its ability to generate over a dozen datasets (including domain frequency statistics, hyperlink network graphs, and extracted full-text). Users are able to select their Archive-It collections for exploration and prompt dataset creation with the push of a button.</description>

      <description>The Archives Unleashed Cloud is Closed
The Cloud shut down on 30 June 2021, and will be replaced by a similar service hosted by Archive-It. Learn more about the transition here.
 Introduction The Archives Unleashed Cloud was an open-source cloud-based analysis tool that helps researchers and scholars conduct web archive analysis. It supported the priorities of accessibility and usability of web archives by providing users with a web-based front end to access the Archives Unleashed Toolkit.</description>

      <description>The Archives Unleashed Toolkit is an open-source platform for analyzing web archives built on Apache Spark, which provides powerful tools for analytics and data processing.
Check out the code on GitHub along with helpful user documentation to get you started using the Archives Unleashed Toolkit. If you want to hack on the Archives Unleashed Toolkit, check out our Java and Scala API documentation.
The Archives Unleashed Toolkit can also be used in conjunction with Spark Notebooks and Apache Zepplin.</description>

      <description>The Archives Unleashed Notebooks are a prototype method for working with derivatives generated by the Archives Unleashed Toolkit. They allow you to interactively explore and filter the domain count information, extracted full text, and network visualization data generated by the Toolkit.
To use them now, please visit the GitHub repository here and follow the instructions.
You can play with a few live demos:

      <description>Warclight is a Project Blacklight based Rails engine that supports the discovery of web archives held in the WARC and ARC formats. It allows faceted full-text search, record view, and other advanced discovery options. Warclight is designed to work with web archive data indexed via the UK Web Archive&amp;rsquo;s webarchive-discovery project. This project grew out of the WALK Project.
You can visit our demo site. For those interested in starting their own Warclight application, the code is available through GitHub, along with extensive documentation.</description>

      <description>There are many ways you can participate in the Archives Unleashed Project.
          Building on the success of our previous datathons, we will be launching the Archives Unleashed Cohort program to engage with and support web archives research. The Cohorts will see research teams participate in year-long intensive collaborations and receive mentorship from the Archives Unleashed team to produce a realized research project, such as a full-length article manuscript.</description>

      <description>About Big Data, in the form of born-digital historical sources, is reshaping the humanities and social sciences. The sheer amount of cultural information that is generated and, crucially, preserved every day in electronic form, presents exciting new opportunities for historians, political scientists, sociologists, linguistics, computer scientists, and other scholars. Much of this information is captured within web archives, created by organizations such as the Internet Archive and many other libraries.</description>

      <description>Archives Unleashed Events Web archives often contain hundreds of billions of web pages, ranging from individual homepages and social media posts to institutional websites. These archives offer tremendous potential for social scientists and humanists, and the questions research may pose stretch across a multitude of fields. Scholars broaching topics dating back to the mid-1990s will find their projects enhanced by web data. Moreover, scholars hoping to study the evolution of cultural and societal phenomena will find a treasure trove of data in web archives.</description>
