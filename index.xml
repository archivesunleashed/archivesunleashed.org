      <description>Archives Unleashed aims to make petabytes of historical internet content accessible to scholars and others interested in researching the recent past. Supported by a grant from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, we will be developing web archive search and data analysis tools to enable scholars and librarians to access, share, and investigate recent history since the early days of the World Wide Web.
Growing out of a series of datathons held at the University of Toronto, Library of Congress, Internet Archive, and the British Library, our team recognized the need for better analytics tools, community infrastructure, and accessible web archival interfaces.</description>

The Archives Unleashed Toolkit is an open-source platform for managing web archives built on Hadoop. The platform provides a flexible data model for storing and managing raw content as well as metadata and extracted knowledge. Tight integration with Hadoop provides powerful tools for analytics and data processing via Spark.
Getting Started Downloading AUT The Archives Unleashed Toolkit can be downloaded as a JAR file for easy use.</description>

      <description>Datathons One of our key priorities is sustainability: crucial to the projectâ€™s success is leveraging an open-source ecosystem. Cognizant of funded projects that run into sustainability issues following a successful launch, we regard regional datathons staged under the Archives Unleashed banner as vital to ensuring broad community buy-in and continued involvement.
The datathon model brings together researchers, programmers, visualization experts, graphical designers, and others into one room in order to facilitate their intensive collaboration on a shared project.</description>
