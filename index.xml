      <description>Archives Unleashed aims to make petabytes of historical internet content accessible to scholars and others interested in researching the recent past. Supported by a grant from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, we are developing web archive search and data analysis tools to enable scholars, librarians and archivists to access, share, and investigate recent history since the early days of the World Wide Web.
Growing out of a series of datathons held at the University of Toronto, Library of Congress, Internet Archive, and the British Library, our team recognized the need for better analytics tools, community infrastructure, and accessible web archival interfaces.</description>

      <description>Overview The Archives Unleashed Project consists of four major tools: the Archives Unleashed Cloud, the Archives Unleashed Toolkit, the Archives Unleashed Jupyter Notebooks and Warclight.
   Tool Skill What it Does What You Need Ideal For      Beginner The Archives Unleashed Cloud is a web-based platform for working with Archive-It collections. Drawing on your Archive-It credentials, you can sync your collections, run basic analyses, and generate a standardized set of research derivatives: full text, network diagrams, and basic statistics on your collection.</description>

      <description>Introduction Imagine a world where you could access and analyze a web archives file in as few as three clicks, with no coding necessary. Oh wait, there&amp;rsquo;s a portal for that: the Archives Unleashed Cloud.
The Archives Unleashed Cloud is an open source cloud-based analysis tool that helps researchers and scholars conduct web archive analysis. It supports the priorities of accessibility and usability of web archives by providing users a web-based front end to access the Archives Unleashed Toolkit.</description>

      <description>Where&amp;#39;s the documentation?
We&amp;rsquo;ve reworked our website, and the documentation now lives here.
 Introduction The Archives Unleashed Toolkit is an open-source platform for analyzing web archives built on Apache Spark, which provides powerful tools for analytics and data processing.
Most of this documentation is built on resilient distributed datasets (RDD). We are working on adding support for DataFrames.
Check out the code on GitHub along with helpful user documentation to get you started using the Archives Unleashed Toolkit.</description>

      <title>Archives Unleashed Jupyter Notebooks</title>

      <guid>https://archivesunleashed.org/notebooks/</guid>
      <description>Introduction We are excited to introduce our Archives Unleashed Jupyter Notebooks, a prototype method for working with the derivatives generated by the Archives Unleashed Cloud. They allow you to interactively explore and filter the domain count information, extracted full text, and network visualization data generated by the Cloud.
We are currently exploring greater integration between the notebooks and the Archives Unleashed Cloud.
To use them now, please visit the GitHub repository here and follow the instructions.</description>

      <guid>https://archivesunleashed.org/warclight/</guid>
      <description>Warclight is a Project Blacklight based Rails engine that supports the discovery of web archives held in the WARC and ARC formats. It allows faceted full-text search, record view, and other advanced discovery options. Warclight is designed to work with web archive data that is indexed via the UK Web Archive&amp;rsquo;s webarchive-discovery project.
You can visit our demo site here, or check out the code on GitHub along with documentation to get you started on your own Warclight application.</description>

      <description>About The World Wide Web has had a profound impact on how we research and understand the past. The sheer amount of cultural information that is generated and, crucially, preserved every day in electronic form, presents exciting new opportunities for researchers. Much of this information is captured within web archives.

      <description>This guide is meant to be a quick reference guide for attendees at the Archives Unleashed datathons. These are commonly-asked questions and options that attendees have used, and may be updated during events.
Screenshots are from Mac, as we don&amp;rsquo;t have a Windows machine on our project team. Our apologies.
Finding Your Terminal While the Archives Unleashed Cloud is easy to use in a web browser, the Archives Unleashed Toolkit requires the use of the command line.</description>
