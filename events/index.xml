      <description>Toronto, April 2018 The Archives Unleashed will host its first datathon in partnership with the University of Toronto Libraries 26-27 April 2018.
Please visit the Toronto event page for more information.
About our Datathons One of our key priorities is sustainability: crucial to the projectâ€™s success is leveraging an open-source ecosystem. Cognizant of funded projects that run into sustainability issues following a successful launch, we regard regional datathons staged under the Archives Unleashed banner as vital to ensuring broad community buy-in and continued involvement.</description>
