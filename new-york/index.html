<p><img src="https://archivesunleashed.org/images/ny-save.png" alt="New York Skyline" /></p>

<h2 id="about">About</h2>

<p>The World Wide Web has had a profound impact on how we research and understand the past. The sheer amount of cultural information that is generated and, crucially, preserved every day in electronic form, presents exciting new opportunities for researchers. Much of this information is captured within web archives.</p>

<p>The project team invites archivists, researchers (from the humanities, social sciences, and beyond), librarians, computer scientists, and web archiving enthusiasts to join us over the course of two days to collaboratively work with web collections and explore cutting-edge research tools through hands-on experience.</p>

<p>The Archives Unleashed Team has partnered with <a href="https://library.columbia.edu"><strong>Columbia University Libraries</strong></a> to host the fourth Archives Unleashed datathon.</p>

<p>This event will bring together a small group to experiment with the newest release of the Archives Unleashed Toolkit and Cloud, and to kick-off collaboratively inspired research projects. Participants will have access to analytics software and specialists, and will be exposed to the process of working with web archive files at scale.</p>

<p>For more information on AUT and the Cloud, please visit <a href="http://archivesunleashed.org/">http://archivesunleashed.org/</a>.</p>
